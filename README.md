# Portfolio Website

## Purpose of the website

The website was created to showcase my ability to design, develop and deploy websites. Additionally, to provide information about me, including my skills, interests and knowledge.
It is important to show professionalism and high work ethics via the site to recruiters who have technical knowledge in the field.

## Target audience

My goal was to grab the attention of employers, who are looking for junior full-stack developers.

## Tech Stack

This portfolio website was built with:

* HTML

* CSS

* SASS-SCSS only.

**Wireframe** design: _Figma_  
**Sitemap**: _FigJam_  
**Code tracking**: _Git_  
**Online Git Repository**: _GitHub_ -[GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/KrisztaT/portfolio)  
**README**: Markdown

## Functionality/Features

### Common functionality/features across the web pages

* Responsiveness: Flexbox and relative measures (such as rem, em, vw, wh, %) were utilised to achieve fully responsive layouts.

* Mobile first design: Throughout the sites media query definitions were used to adapt to different viewport sizes from mobile view.

```css
 /* As the screenshots below present the footer of the mobile and tablet-desktop view is different. Below code presents the desktop view, as the main scss body contains the mobile view */
@media screen and (min-width: 1025px) {

.footer {
    position:relative;
    bottom:0;
    width:100vw;
    height: 100px; 
    margin-top: auto;
    border-top: 2px solid $clr-cards;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row-reverse;
    justify-content: space-around;
    align-items: center; 
    color: $clr-general-txt;

    .foot-txt{
      text-align: left;
      
    }

  }
}
```

* Default values: Default values were defined and imported into the style.scss file (i.e.: background color, font sizes, font family [^1] button definitions etc.) to achieve consistent appearance and viewport-dependent design (such as bigger font sizes on desktop view etc.) through the pages.

* Navigation: The header contains the navigation bar to mobile (hamburger menu) and tablet-desktop view. The navigation is responding to hovering and clicking. The anchors provide a smooth journey to one page to another.

* Logo: Logo is an anchor to the home page. [^2]

* Buttons: All buttons upon hovering is responsive and change their color.

* Footer: The footer contains the social media, the home page, email me, and call me icons. [^3] All icons are linked to the appropriate websites, mail, and call service. All icons change color upon hovering for maximum effect.

## Sitemap

![Sitemap](./img/md/sitemap.png)

The index page is the landing/home page of the portfolio website, which the user sees upon loading the page. Thanks to the navigation in the header, which can be seen on the top of all sites, all pages can be accessed from another. The only exception is the Blog posts page, which is accessible from the blog.html site only.
